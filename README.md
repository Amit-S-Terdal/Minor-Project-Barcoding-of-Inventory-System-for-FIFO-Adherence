üöÄ Barcoding of Inventory System for FIFO Adherence üöÄ

In today‚Äôs fast-paced industrial environment, efficient inventory management is crucial for maintaining productivity and reducing waste. At Spicer India, the manual tracking of manufactured parts and adherence to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle was prone to errors, leading to potential losses and inefficiencies.

To address this challenge, we developed a web-based inventory management system that automates the barcoding process, tracks product locations, and ensures FIFO adherence. The system generates unique QR codes for each product, enabling real-time tracking of inventory from manufacturing to export.

üîç Key Features and Achievements:

Automated QR code generation for each product, reducing manual errors.
Real-time tracking of product locations within racks and containers.
FIFO-based dispatching to ensure the oldest products are exported first.
A user-friendly web portal for admins to manage products, view inventory, and search for items.
Integration of a database to store product details, manufacturing dates, and locations.
Django framework for backend development, ensuring scalability and security.

This project not only streamlined Spicer India‚Äôs inventory management process but also significantly reduced human effort and minimized the risk of product expiration or mismanagement.

üí° Future Enhancements:

Development of a mobile application for scanning QR codes and retrieving product details.
Optimization of the system‚Äôs performance for larger datasets.
Expansion of the web portal to include additional features based on industry requirements.
